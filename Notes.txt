1. First rule of creating an abstract class is to use the keyword
'abstract' 

2. We cannot create instances/objects from abstract

Short, Double, Float, all these 6 concrete classes extend from Number class which
is abstract

3. Abstract classes can have concrete methods as well as abstract methods:
Concrete method: is a method with a method body
Abstract method: is a method that does not have a method body

abstract method in a concrete class, it will work
